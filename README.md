# Foundation Models for Autonomous Robots in Unstructured Environments

Automating activities in unstructured environments, such as construction sites, has been challenging due to unpredictable events, limiting robot adoption compared to structured settings. Recently, pretrained foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise in addressing this challenge through superior generalization capabilities. This study employed a multi-dimensional method that systematically review the field from different perspectives: foundation models in robotics and unstructured environments, and finally synthesized them with deliberative acting theory. Findings revealed that LLMs' linguistic capabilities are primarily used to improve perception and human-robot interactions in robotic tasks, while applications in project management, safety, and natural hazard detection are the most utilized applications of foundation models in unstructured environments. We positioned the current state-of-the-art on a five-level automation scale at conditional automation. These findings informed future scenarios, challenges, and solutions toward autonomous safe unstructured environments. Our study serves as a benchmark to track our progress toward that future.
